# Chess_Evaluation_Neural_Network
A Neural Network that attempts to estimate the evaluation given the board position. Tries to mimic stockfish 11.

Currently, this serves as a log of development progress.

August 16th: 
- Training for models evaluating white positions started.

August 29th:
- Models for evaluating the positions in which white is to move are done.
- Currently in the process of training models in which black is to move. 

Will be updated soon!
